Revision history for Session-Storage-Secure

{{$NEXT}}

    [!!! Compatibility Notice !!!]

    - This version introduces protocol version 2.  By default, newly generated
      output will be encoded using version 2.  Old data created with old
      versions of this module will still be readable, whether using the same
      secret or the old_secrets array.

    - Protocol version 2 key features include: salt length increased to 256
      bits and binary encoded; no longer uses a deprecated Crypt::CBC key
      derivation function; protocol version appended to the generated output.

    [FIXED]

    - Protocol version 1 suppresses 'opensslv1' key-derivation function
      deprecation warnings from Crypt::CBC.

    [PREREQS]

    - Requires Crypt::CBC 3.01

    - Bumped prereq on Sereal::Decoder to 4.005

0.010     2014-05-04 13:52:13-04:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for customizing options to Sereal encoder and decoder,
      i.e. to allow object serialization for those willing to accept the
      risks of doing so.  (Thanks to Breno de Oliveira for inspiration to
      do this.)

0.009     2014-04-17 17:15:25-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed bug that would cause custom encoding tests to fail
      intermittently

0.008     2014-04-17 16:29:50-04:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for keeping an array of old keys for decryption
      (Tom Hukins)

    - Added support for replacing MIME::Base64 encoding with user-specified
      transport encoding/decoding, possibly with a custom separator

    [INTERNAL]

    - Update repository support and meta files

0.007     2013-05-31 23:30:44 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Replaced HMAC equality check with a constant-time comparison
      to foil timing attacks

0.006     2013-02-06 22:56:45 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Made MooX::Types::MooseLike prereq explicit to try to address
      prereqs failures by some testers

0.005     2013-02-01 13:55:34 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Added some defensive code to try to avoid test failures on Perl 5.8

0.004     2013-01-25 15:10:34 America/New_York

    [CHANGES]

    - Seeding is now done by Crypt::URandom, which uses the best
      non-blocking source of random data on a given platform, including
      Win32

0.003     2013-01-17 08:47:45 America/New_York

    [BUG FIXES]

    - ISAAC is now seeded from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random to avoid
      blocking.  urandom is sufficient for seeding a CPRNG that itself is
      generating salt to permute the actual secret key.

0.002     2013-01-15 23:06:47 America/New_York

    [BUG FIXES]

    - Specify MIME::Base64 3.12 as minimum for encode/decode_base64url

0.001     2013-01-10 22:07:12 America/New_York

    - First release
